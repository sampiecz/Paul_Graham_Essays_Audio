{"Title": ["General and Surprising"], "Content": ["September 2017", "The most valuable insights are both general and surprising.\nF\u00a0=\u00a0ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard\ncombination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked\nclean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.", "Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the\nother: either surprising without being general (e.g.\ngossip), or general without being surprising (e.g.\nplatitudes).", "Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable\ninsights.  You get those from small additions of whichever\nquality was missing.  The more common case is a small\naddition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than\njust gossip, because it teaches something interesting about\nthe world. But another less common approach is to focus on\nthe most general ideas and see if you can find something new\nto say about them. Because these start out so general, you\nonly need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful\ninsight.", "A small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most\nof the time. Which means if you take this route your ideas\nwill seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes\nyou'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did\nalready exist.  But don't be discouraged.  Remember the huge\nmultiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of\nsomething even a little new.", "Corollary: the more general the ideas you're talking about,\nthe less you should worry about repeating yourself.  If you\nwrite enough, it's inevitable you will.  Your brain is much\nthe same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit\nit. I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something\nclose to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing\nmyself. But rationally one shouldn't.  You won't say\nsomething exactly the same way the second time, and that\nvariation increases the chance you'll get that tiny but\ncritical delta of novelty.", "And of course, ideas beget ideas.  (That sounds familiar.)\nAn idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one\nwith more. But only if you keep going. So it's doubly\nimportant not to let yourself be discouraged by people who\nsay there's not much new about something you've discovered.\n\"Not much new\" is a real achievement when you're talking\nabout the most general ideas. Maybe if you keep going,\nyou'll discover more.", "It's not true that there's nothing new under the sun.  There\nare some domains where there's almost nothing new.

{"Title": ["What I've Learned from Hacker News"], "Content": ["February 2009", "Hacker News was two years\nold last week.  Initially it was supposed to be a side project\u2014an\napplication to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future\nY Combinator founders to exchange news.  It's grown bigger and taken\nup more time than I expected, but I don't regret that because I've\nlearned so much from working on it.", "When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600\ndaily uniques.  It's since ", " to around 22,000.  This growth\nrate is a bit higher than I'd like.  I'd like the site to grow,\nsince a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead.\nBut I wouldn't want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit\u2014mainly\nbecause that would dilute the character of the site, but also because\nI don't want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.", "I already have problems enough with that.  Remember, the original\nmotivation for HN was to test a new programming language, and\nmoreover one that's focused on experimenting with language design,\nnot performance.  Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myself\nby recalling McIlroy and Bentley's famous quote\n", "\nand look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code.  So far\nI've been able to keep up, in the sense that performance has remained\nconsistently mediocre despite 14x growth. I don't know what I'll\ndo next, but I'll probably think of something.", "This is my attitude to the site generally.  Hacker News is an\nexperiment, and an experiment in a very young field.  Sites of this\ntype are only a few years old.  Internet conversation generally is\nonly a few decades old.  So we've probably only discovered a fraction\nof what we eventually will.", "That's why I'm so optimistic about HN.  When a technology is this\nyoung, the existing solutions are usually terrible; which means it\nmust be possible to do much better; which means many problems that\nseem insoluble aren't. Including, I hope, the problem that has\nafflicted so many previous communities: being ruined by growth.", "Users have worried about that since the site was a few months old.\nSo far these alarms have been false, but they may not always be.\nDilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it doesn't mean\nmuch that open conversations have \"always\" been destroyed by growth\nwhen \"always\" equals 20 instances.", "But it's important to remember we're trying to solve a new problem,\nbecause that means we're going to have to try new things, most of\nwhich probably won't work.  A couple weeks ago I tried displaying\nthe names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange.\n", "[", "1", "]", "\nThat was a mistake.

{"Title": ["How to Be an Angel Investor"], "Content": ["March 2009", "When we sold our startup in 1998 I thought one day I'd do some angel\ninvesting.  Seven years later I still hadn't started.  I put it off\nbecause it seemed mysterious and complicated.   It turns out to be \neasier than I expected, and also more interesting.", "The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really\nisn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock.  You'll\nprobably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra\nrights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible\ndebt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and\nthe debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding\nround. \n", "[", "1", "]", "There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the\nother.  The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler.  But really\nit doesn't matter much which you use.  Don't spend much time worrying\nabout the details of deal terms, especially when you first start\nangel investing.  That's not how you win at this game.  When you\nhear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not\nsaying \"He got a 4x liquidation preference.\" They're saying \"He\ninvested in Google.\"", "That's how you win: by investing in the right startups.  That is\nso much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading\nyou by even talking about other things.", "Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together\nto invest on the same terms.  In a syndicate there is usually a\n\"lead\" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup.  But not\nalways: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of\ninvestors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer\nsupplies the paperwork.", "The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a\nfriend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.\nThen all you have to do is write checks.", "Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though.  It's not that\nhard to do it yourself.  You can just use the standard \n", "\ndocuments Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.\nYou should of course have your lawyer review everything.  Both you\nand the startup should have lawyers.  But the lawyers don't have\nto create the agreement from scratch.  \n", "2", "\nWhen you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you\ncare about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of\nthe company.  The valuation determines how much stock you get.  If\nyou put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1\nmillion, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you\nget .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock.", "If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take\na chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just\nas you did.  If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to\na new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.", "That's ok.  Dilution is normal.  What saves you from being mistreated\nin future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the\nfounders.  They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just\nas much.  And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up \n", ".  So in theory, each further \nround of investment leaves you\nwith a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after\nseveral more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point\nwhere it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has\nbecome $5 million. \n", "3", "The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that \nlet you contribute to\nfuture rounds to maintain your percentage.  So it's your choice\nwhether you get diluted.  \n", "4", "\nIf the company does really well,\nyou eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so\nhigh it's not worth it for you.", "How much does an angel invest?  That varies enormously, from $10,000\nto hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions.

Programming language design\nwill not be about whether to make your language strongly or weakly\ntyped, or object oriented, or functional, or whatever, but about\nhow to design great libraries. The kind of language designers who\nlike to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this.\nIt's almost like writing applications! Too bad. Languages are for\nprogrammers, and libraries are what programmers need.", "It's hard to design good libraries. It's not simply a matter of\nwriting a lot of code. Once the libraries get too big, it can\nsometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write\nthe code yourself. Libraries need to be designed using a small set\nof orthogonal operators, just like the core language. It ought to\nbe possible for the programmer to guess what library call will do\nwhat he needs.", "Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short. There are only\nrudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost none\nfor talking to the operating system. For historical reasons, Common\nLisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist. And because you\ncan't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious\nprogram using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. You have\nto use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice\nthese tend not to give you everything you want. Hackers would think\na lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string\nlibraries and good OS support.", "Could a language with Lisp's syntax, or more precisely, lack of\nsyntax, ever become popular? I don't know the answer to this\nquestion. I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp isn't\ncurrently popular. Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliar\nsyntax. I know several programmers who are comfortable with prefix\nsyntax and yet use Perl by default, because it has powerful string\nlibraries and can talk to the os.", "There are two possible problems with prefix notation: that it is\nunfamiliar to programmers, and that it is not dense enough. The\nconventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is\nthe real one. I'm not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary\nprogrammers panic. But I don't think ordinary programmers' opinions\nmatter. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert\nhackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to\ndeal with prefix notation. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible,\nbut that has not stood in the way of Perl's popularity. If anything\nit may have helped foster a Perl cult.", "A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation. For\nexpert hackers, that really is a problem. No one wants to write\n(aref a x y) when they could write a[x,y].", "In this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out of\nthe problem. If we treat data structures as if they were functions\non indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorter\nthan the Perl form. Similar tricks may shorten other types of\nexpressions.", "We can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by making\nindentation significant. That's how programmers read code anyway:\nwhen indentation says one thing and delimiters say another, we go\nby the indentation. Treating indentation as significant would\neliminate this common source of bugs as well as making programs\nshorter.", "Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read. This is especially true\nfor math expressions. I've used Lisp my whole programming life and\nI still don't find prefix math expressions natural. And yet it is\nconvenient, especially when you're generating code, to have operators\nthat take any number of arguments. So if we do have infix syntax,\nit should probably be implemented as some kind of read-macro.", "I don't think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax\ninto Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood way into\nunderlying s-expressions. There is already a good deal of syntax\nin Lisp. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no\none is forced to use it. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved\nfor the language, suggesting that at least some of the designers\nintended to have more syntax in the future.", "One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp\noccurs in format strings; format is a language in its own right,\nand that language is not Lisp. If there were a plan for introducing\nmore syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be included\nin it. It would be a good thing if macros could generate format\nspecifiers the way they generate any other kind of code.", "An eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open to\nthe section format. Mine too. This probably indicates room for\nimprovement. It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O.", "A good language, as everyone knows, should generate fast code. But\nin practice I don't think fast code comes primarily from things\nyou do in the design of the language. As Knuth pointed out long\nago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks.  And as\nmany programmers have observed since, one is very often mistaken\nabout where these bottlenecks are.", "So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good\nprofiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed.\nYou don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in\nthe program. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments\nin the bottlenecks. And even more, you need to be able to find out\nwhere the bottlenecks are.", "One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell\nwhat's expensive. This might be true. It might also be inevitable,\nif you want to have a very abstract language. And in any case I\nthink good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem:\nyou'd soon learn what was expensive.", "Part of the problem here is social. Language designers like to\nwrite fast compilers. That's how they measure their skill. They\nthink of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a good\nprofiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written\nin the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here,\nagain, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their\nusers. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong\nproblem.", "It might be a good idea to have an active profiler-- to push\nperformance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to\ncome asking for it. For example, the editor could display bottlenecks\nin red when the programmer edits the source code. Another approach\nwould be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs.\nThis would be an especially big win in server-based applications,\nwhere you have lots of running programs to look at. An active\nprofiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a\nprogram's running, or even make sounds that tell what's happening.", "Sound is a good cue to problems. In one place I worked, we had a\nbig board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers.\nThe hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise\nwhen they turned. I couldn't see the board from my desk, but I\nfound that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there was\na problem with a server.", "It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automatically\ndetect inefficient algorithms.

Then such optimizations would be portable too.", "The nature of speed, as perceived by the end-user, may be changing.\nWith the rise of server-based applications, more and more programs\nmay turn out to be i/o-bound.

But another kind of efficiency\nwill be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users\nyou can support per processor. Many of the interesting applications\nwritten in the near future will be server-based, and the number of\nusers per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such\napplications. In the capital cost of a business offering a server-based\napplication, this is the divisor.", "For years, efficiency hasn't mattered much in most end-user\napplications. Developers have been able to assume that each user\nwould have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their\ndesk. And by Parkinson's Law, software has expanded to use the\nresources available. That will change with server-based applications.\nIn that world, the hardware and software will be supplied together.\nFor companies that offer server-based applications, it will make\na very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can\nsupport per server.", "In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor,\nand execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize.\nBut often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous\nusers will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each\nuser's data. The language can help here too. Good support for\nthreads will enable all the users to share a single heap. It may\nalso help to have persistent objects and/or language level support\nfor lazy loading.", "The last ingredient a popular language needs is time. No one wants\nto write programs in a language that might go away, as so many\nprogramming languages do. So most hackers will tend to wait until\na language has been around for a couple years before even considering\nusing it.", "Inventors of wonderful new things are often surprised to discover\nthis, but you need time to get any message through to people. A\nfriend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone asks\nhim. He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turn\nout not to want. To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the third\nor fourth time he's asked to do something; by then, whoever's asking\nhim may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do\nwant whatever they're asking for.", "Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new\nthings they hear about. They don't even start paying attention\nuntil they've heard about something ten times. They're perfectly\njustified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a\nwaste of time, and eventually go away. By delaying learning VRML,\nI avoided having to learn it at all.", "So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating\ntheir message for years before people will start to get it.

Nothing could be better,\nfor a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small\nnumber of early adopters. Early adopters are sophisticated and\ndemanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your\ntechnology. When you only have a few users you can be in close\ncontact with all of them.

At most software\ncompanies, support people are underpaid human shields, and hackers\nare little copies of God the Father, creators of the world.  Whatever\nthe procedure for reporting bugs, it is likely to be one-directional:\nsupport people who hear about bugs fill out some form that eventually\ngets passed on (possibly via QA) to programmers, who put it on\ntheir list of things to do.  It was very different at Viaweb.\nWithin a minute of hearing about a bug from a customer, the support\npeople could be standing next to a programmer hearing him say \"Shit,\nyou're right, it's a bug.\" It delighted the support people to hear\nthat \"you're right\" from the hackers.

It was only then that we\nrealized that they were effectively QA and to some extent marketing\nas well.  In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers of\nthe knowledge of vaguer, buglike things, like features that confused\nusers.

The thing about ideas,\nthough, is that they lead to more ideas.  Have you ever noticed\nthat when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end\nup in it are ones you thought of while writing it?  The same thing\nhappens with software.  Working to implement one idea gives you\nmore ideas.  So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in\nimplementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it would\nhave led to.  In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits new\nideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight\nof the shelf and think \"but I already have a lot of new things I\nwant to do for the next release.\"", "What big companies do instead of implementing features is plan\nthem.  At Viaweb we sometimes ran into trouble on this account.\nInvestors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the\nfuture.  The truthful answer would have been, we didn't have any\nplans.  We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve,\nbut if we knew how we would have done it already.  What were we\ngoing to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggest\nwin.

Only 13 of\nthese were in product development.  All the rest were working on\nreleases, ports, and so on.  With Web-based software, all you need\n(at most) are the 13 people, because there are no releases, ports,\nand so on.", "Viaweb was written by just three people.

The larger the group, the more time\nthey'll spend in meetings negotiating how their software will work\ntogether, and the more bugs they'll get from unforeseen interactions.\nFortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups get\nsmaller, software development gets exponentially more efficient.\nI can't remember the programmers at Viaweb ever having an actual\nmeeting.  We never had more to say at any one time than we could\nsay as we were walking to lunch.", "If there is a downside here, it is that all the programmers have\nto be to some degree system administrators as well.  When you're\nhosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, and in\npractice the only people who can do this properly are the ones who\nwrote the software.  At Viaweb our system had so many components\nand changed so frequently that there was no definite border between\nsoftware and infrastructure.  Arbitrarily declaring such a border\nwould have constrained our design choices.  And so although we were\nconstantly hoping that one day (\"in a couple months\") everything\nwould be stable enough that we could hire someone whose job was\njust to worry about the servers, it never happened.", "I don't think it could be any other way, as long as you're still\nactively developing the product.  Web-based software is never going\nto be something you write, check in, and go home.  It's a live\nthing, running on your servers right now.  A bad bug might not just\ncrash one user's process; it could crash them all.  If a bug in\nyour code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it.  And so\non.

You don't release code late\nat night and then go home.", "With server-based software, you're in closer touch with your code.\nYou can also be in closer touch with your users.

But you can't have\nany idea what users will be thinking, believe me, until you watch\nthem.  And server-based software gives you unprecedented information\nabout their behavior.

You\nhave to consider carefully what you're going to look at, because\nyou don't want to violate users' privacy, but even the most general\nstatistical sampling can be very useful.", "When you have the users on your server, you don't have to rely on\nbenchmarks, for example.  Benchmarks are simulated users.  With\nserver-based software, you can watch actual users.  To decide what\nto optimize, just log into a server and see what's consuming all\nthe CPU.  And you know when to stop optimizing too: we eventually\ngot the Viaweb editor to the point where it was memory-bound rather\nthan CPU-bound, and since there was nothing we could do to decrease\nthe size of users' data (well, nothing easy), we knew we might as\nwell stop there.", "Efficiency matters for server-based software, because you're paying\nfor the hardware.  The number of users you can support per server\nis the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can make your software\nvery efficient you can undersell competitors and still make a\nprofit.  At Viaweb we got the capital cost per user down to about\n$5.  It would be less now, probably less than the cost of sending\nthem the first month's bill.  Hardware is free now, if your software\nis reasonably efficient.", "Watching users can guide you in design as well as optimization.\nViaweb had a scripting language called RTML that let advanced users\ndefine their own page styles.  We found that RTML became a kind of\nsuggestion box, because users only used it when the predefined page\nstyles couldn't do what they wanted.  Originally the editor put\nbutton bars across the page, for example, but after a number of\nusers used RTML to put buttons down the left \n", ", \nwe made that an\noption (in fact the default) in the predefined page styles.", "Finally, by watching users you can often tell when they're in\ntrouble.  And since the customer is always right, that's a sign of\nsomething you need to fix.  At Viaweb the key to getting users was\nthe online test drive.  It was not just a series of slides built\nby marketing people.  In our test drive, users actually used the\nsoftware.  It took about five minutes, and at the end of it they\nhad built a real, working store.", "\nThe test drive was the way we got nearly all our new users.  I\nthink it will be the same for most Web-based applications.   If\nusers can get through a test drive successfully, they'll like the\nproduct.  If they get confused or bored, they won't.  So anything\nwe could do to get more people through the test drive would increase\nour growth rate.", "I studied click trails of people taking the test drive and found\nthat at a certain step they would get confused and click on the\nbrowser's Back button.  (If you try writing Web-based applications,\nyou'll find that the Back button becomes one of your most interesting\nphilosophical problems.) So I added a message at that point, telling\nusers that they were nearly finished, and reminding them not to\nclick on the Back button.  Another great thing about Web-based\nsoftware is that you get instant feedback from changes:  the number\nof people completing the test drive rose immediately from 60% to\n90%.  And since the number of new users was a function of the number\nof completed test drives, our revenue growth increased by 50%, just\nfrom that change.", "In the early 1990s I read an article in which someone said that\nsoftware was a subscription business.  At first this seemed a very\ncynical statement.  But later I realized that it reflects reality:\nsoftware development is an ongoing process.  I think it's cleaner\nif you openly charge subscription fees, instead of forcing people\nto keep buying and installing new versions so that they'll keep\npaying you.

This\nis why some software costs more to run on Suns than on Intel boxes:\na company that uses Suns is not interested in saving money and can\nsafely be charged more.  Piracy is effectively the lowest tier of\nprice discrimination.  I think that software companies understand\nthis and deliberately turn a blind eye to some kinds of piracy.

You might think that people\ndecide to buy something, and then buy it, as two separate steps.\nThat's what I thought before Viaweb, to the extent I thought about\nthe question at all.  In fact the second step can propagate back\ninto the first: if something is hard to buy, people will change\ntheir mind about whether they wanted it.  And vice versa: you'll\nsell more of something when it's easy to buy.  I buy more books\nbecause Amazon exists.

A prototype doesn't have to\nbe just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.\nI think you should always do this when you can.  It lets you\ntake advantage of new insights you have along the way.  But\nperhaps even more important, it's good for morale.", "Morale is key in design.  I'm surprised people\ndon't talk more about it.  One of my first\ndrawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're\ndrawing something, the drawing will look boring.\nFor example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you\ndecide to draw each brick individually.  You can do this\nif you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start\nmaking the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,   \nthe drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested\nthe bricks.", "Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good\nfor morale because it keeps you engaged.  In software, my  \nrule is: always have working code.  If you're writing\nsomething that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you\nhave the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.\nThe same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.\nMost painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually\nrefine it.\nIf you work this way, then in principle\nyou never have to end the day with something that actually\nlooks unfinished.  Indeed, there is even a saying among\npainters: \"A painting is never finished, you just stop\nworking on it.\"  This idea will be familiar to anyone who\nhas worked on software.", "Morale is another reason that it's hard to design something\nfor an unsophisticated user.   It's hard to stay interested in\nsomething you don't like yourself.  To make something  \ngood, you have to be thinking, \"wow, this is really great,\"\nnot \"what a piece of shit; those fools will love it.\"", "Design means making things for humans.

The designer is human too.", "Notice all this time I've been talking about \"the designer.\"\nDesign usually has to be under the control of a single person to\nbe any good.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people\nto collaborate on a research project.  This seems to\nme one of the most interesting differences between research and\ndesign.", "There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts,\nbut most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather\nthan nuclear fusion.  In an opera it's common for one person to\nwrite the libretto and another to write the music.   And during the Renaissance, \njourneymen from northern\nEurope were often employed to do the landscapes in the\nbackgrounds of Italian paintings.  But these aren't true collaborations.\nThey're more like examples of Robert Frost's\n\"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances\nof good design together, but within each individual project,\none person has to be in control.", "I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think\nof everything.  There's nothing more valuable than the advice\nof someone whose judgement you trust.  But after the talking is\ndone, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.", "Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and  \ndesign can't?  This is an interesting question.  I don't \nknow the answer.  Perhaps,\nif design and research converge, the best research is also\ngood design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.\nA lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.\nBut I don't know enough to say whether there\nis a pattern here.  It could be simply that many famous scientists\nworked when collaboration was less common.", "Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration\nseems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  Design by committee is a\nsynonym for bad design.  Why is that so?  Is there some way to\nbeat this limitation?", "I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires\na dictator.  One reason is that good design has to   \nbe all of a piece.  Design is not just for humans, but\nfor individual humans.  If a design represents an idea that  \nfits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the user's\nhead too."]},

I use the\n15 most interesting to decide if mail is spam.\nBut you can run into a problem when you use a fixed number\nlike this.  If you find a lot of maximally interesting tokens,\nthe result can end up being decided by whatever random factor\ndetermines the ordering of equally interesting tokens.\nOne way to deal with this is to treat some\nas more interesting than others.", "For example, the\ntoken ``dalco'' occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never\nin my legitimate corpus.  The token ``Url*optmails''\n(meaning ``optmails'' within a url) occurs 1223 times.\nAnd yet, as I used to calculate probabilities for tokens,\nboth would have the same spam probability, the threshold of .99.", "That doesn't feel right.  There are theoretical\narguments for giving these two tokens substantially different\nprobabilities (Pantel and Lin do), but I haven't tried that yet.\nIt does seem at least that if we find more than 15 tokens\nthat only occur in one corpus or the other, we ought to\ngive priority to the ones that occur a lot.  So now\nthere are two threshold values.  For tokens that occur only\nin the spam corpus, the probability is .9999 if they\noccur more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise.  Ditto\nat the other end of the scale for tokens found\nonly in the legitimate corpus.", "I may later scale token probabilities substantially,\nbut this tiny amount of scaling at least ensures that \ntokens get sorted the right way.", "Another possibility would be to consider not\njust 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certain\nthreshold of interestingness.

I look at a, img, and font tags, and ignore the\nrest.  Links and images you should certainly look at, because\nthey contain urls.", "I could probably be smarter about dealing with html, but I\ndon't think it's worth putting a lot of time into this.\nSpams full of html are easy to filter.

I never\nasked to receive them, so arguably they\nwere spams, but I count them as false positives because\nI hadn't been deleting them as spams before.  The reason\nthe filters caught them was that both companies in   \nJanuary switched to commercial email senders\ninstead of sending the mails from their own servers,  \nand both the headers and the bodies became much spammier.", "The third false positive was a bad one, though.  It was \nfrom someone in Egypt and written in all uppercase.  This was\na direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Plan\nfor Spam filter wouldn't have caught it.", "It's hard to say what the overall false positive rate is,\nbecause we're up in the noise, statistically.\nAnyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) will\nbe aware of this problem.\nWith some emails it's\nhard to say whether they're spam or not, and these are\nthe ones you end up looking at when you get filters       \nreally tight.  For example, so far the filter has\ncaught two emails that were sent to my address because\nof a typo, and one sent to me in the belief that I was \nsomeone else.  Arguably, these are neither my spam\nnor my nonspam mail.", "Another false positive was from a vice president at Virtumundo.\nI wrote to them pretending to be a customer,\nand since the reply came back through Virtumundo's \nmail servers it had the most incriminating\nheaders imaginable.

E tables contained the\nkids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of\nthe time we called \"retards.\"", "We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking\nphysically different.

Puberty finally arrived;\nI became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground\nnewspaper.  So I've seen a good part of the popularity landscape.", "I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell\nthe same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart\nand being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between\nbeing a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to ", " you\nunpopular.", "Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to\nask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to\nimagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart\ndoesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm\nyou in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem\nso bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary\nschool, being smart is likely to make your life difficult.  Why?", "\nThe key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why\ndon't smart kids make themselves popular? If they're so smart, why\ndon't they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,\njust as they do for standardized tests?", "One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart\nkids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,\nand nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the\nother kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job\nof concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an\nenviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that\nguys envy, girls like.", "In the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much. Kids\ndidn't admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they\nwould have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the\ndumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical\nappearance, charisma, or athletic ability.", "So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are\nsmart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that\nthey don't really want to be popular.", "If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at\nhim. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them\nso miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn't\nwant to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of\nthirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of course\nI wanted to be popular.", "But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted\nmore: to be smart.

I've read that this is why poor whites in the United\nStates are the group most hostile to blacks.", "But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's\npart of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially\nabout individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances.\nTo become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that\nbring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people\ncloser than a common enemy.", "Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at\nhome, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling\nout and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the\nhierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider\nmakes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying\nhappen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from\na group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.", "If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal. The\ngroup of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same\nthing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together\nto go hunting. They don't actually hate you. They just need something\nto chase.", "Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target\nfor the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular\nkids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things.\nMost of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous\nmiddle classes.", "The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of\npopularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear.\nThe least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only\nD table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want\nto pick on nerds than there are nerds.", "As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids,\none loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that\nin high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking\nto them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity\nis a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still\nostracize them in self-defense.", "It's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle\nschool and high school. Their other interests leave them little\nattention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles\na zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole\nschool. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens\nwithout any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the\nsituation.", "\nFor me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new\nand harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate\nthe smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I've talked to\nagrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.", "In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen\nfor me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our\nteachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and\nwas so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an\neloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.", "It didn't have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time\nwas that she was surprised. You mean she doesn't know the kind of\nthings they say to one another? You mean this isn't normal?", "It's important to realize that, no, the adults don't know what the\nkids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that\nkids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the\nabstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like\nus, they don't like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don't\nsee evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.", "Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison\nwardens.

The future is pretty long.  If there's\nsomething we can do to decrease the number of axioms in the core\nlanguage, that would seem to be the side to bet on as t approaches\ninfinity.  If the idea still seems unbearable in a hundred years,\nmaybe it won't in a thousand.", "Just to be clear about this, I'm not proposing that all numerical\ncalculations would actually be carried out using lists.  I'm proposing\nthat the core language, prior to any additional notations about\nimplementation, be defined this way.  In practice any program\nthat wanted to do any amount of math would probably represent\nnumbers in binary, but this would be an optimization, not part of\nthe core language semantics.", "Another way to burn up cycles is to have many layers of\nsoftware between the application and the hardware.

This extra cost buys you flexibility.", "The very first version of Arc was an extreme case of this sort\nof multi-level slowness, with corresponding benefits.  It\nwas a classic \"metacircular\" interpreter written\non top of Common Lisp, with a definite family resemblance\nto the eval function defined in McCarthy's original Lisp paper.\nThe whole thing was only a couple hundred lines of\ncode, so it was very easy to understand and change.  The \nCommon Lisp we used, CLisp, itself runs on top\nof a byte code interpreter.

It's also the best route to   \nthat holy grail, reusability.  A language is by definition\nreusable.

It seemed the essence of what scholars did.  As\nEuropean scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;\nby 1350\nsomeone who wanted to learn about science could find better\nteachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1]\nBut schools change slower than scholarship.  In the\n19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone\nof the curriculum.", "The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of\nancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern\ntexts?  The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre\nof classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that\ndoes not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.\nBut for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.\nThe archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that\nthose studying the classics were, if not wasting their\ntime, at least working on problems of minor importance.", "And so began the study of modern literature.

What should they\ndo research on?  The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3]", "And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited\nby English professors.

Class projects will inevitably\nsolve fake problems.  For one thing, real problems are rare and\nvaluable.  If a professor wanted to have students solve real problems,\nhe'd face the same paradox as someone trying to give an example of\nwhatever \"paradigm\" might succeed the Standard Model of physics.\nThere may well be something that does, but if you could think of\nan example you'd be entitled to the Nobel Prize.  Similarly, good\nnew problems are not to be had for the asking.", "In technology the difficulty is compounded by the fact that real\nstartups tend to discover the problem they're solving by a process\nof evolution.  Someone has an idea for something; they build it;\nand in doing so (and probably only by doing so) they realize\nthe problem they should be solving is another one.  Even if the\nprofessor let you change your project description on the fly, there\nisn't time enough to do that in a college class, or a market to\nsupply evolutionary pressures.  So class\nprojects are mostly about implementation, which is the least\nof your problems in a startup.", "It's not just that in a startup you work on the idea as well as\nimplementation.  The very implementation is different.  Its main\npurpose is to refine the idea.  Often the only value of most of the\nstuff you build in the first six months is that it proves your\ninitial idea was mistaken.  And that's extremely valuable.  If\nyou're free of a misconception that everyone else still shares,\nyou're in a powerful position.  But you're not thinking that way\nabout a class project.  Proving your initial plan was mistaken would\njust get you a bad grade.  Instead of building stuff to throw away,\nyou tend to want every line of code to go toward that final goal\nof showing you did a lot of work.", "That leads to our second difference: the way class projects are\nmeasured.

Users just want your software to do what they\nneed, and you get a zero otherwise.  That is one of the most\ndistinctive differences between school and the real world: there\nis no reward for putting in a good effort.

But unfortunately when you\ngraduate they don't give you a list of all the lies they told you\nduring your education.  You have to get them beaten out of you by\ncontact with the real world.  And this is why so many jobs want\nwork experience.  I couldn't understand that when I was in college.\nI knew how to program.  In fact, I could tell I knew how to program\nbetter than most people doing it for a living.  So what was this\nmysterious \"work experience\" and why did I need it?", "Now I know what it is, and part of the confusion is grammatical.\nDescribing it as \"work experience\" implies it's like experience\noperating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain programming\nlanguage.  But really what work experience refers to is not some\nspecific expertise, but the elimination of certain habits left over\nfrom childhood.", "One of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake.  When\nyou're a kid and you face some hard test, you can cry and say \"I\ncan't\" and they won't make you do it.  Of course, no one can make\nyou do anything in the grownup world either.  What they do instead\nis fire you.  And when motivated by that\nyou find you can do a lot more than you realized.  So one of the\nthings employers expect from someone with \"work experience\" is the\nelimination of the flake reflex\u2014the ability to get things done,\nwith no excuses.", "The other thing you get from work experience is an understanding\nof what work is, and in particular, how intrinsically horrible it\nis.  Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to spend\nmost of your waking hours doing stuff someone else wants, or starve.\nThere are a few places where the work is so interesting that this\nis concealed, because what other people want done happens to coincide\nwith what you want to work on.  But you only have to imagine what\nwould happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality.", "It's not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explain\nit.  They never explain what the deal is with money.  You know from\nan early age that you'll have some sort of job, because everyone\nasks what you're going to \"be\" when you grow up. What they\ndon't tell you is that as a kid you're sitting on the shoulders of\nsomeone else who's treading water, and that starting working means\nyou get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading\nwater yourself or sink.  \"Being\" something is incidental; the\nimmediate problem is not to drown.", "The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only\ngradually.

To someone who has learned from\nexperience about the relationship between money and work, it\ntranslates to something way more important: it means you get to opt\nout of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9% of people.\nGetting rich means you can stop treading water.", "Someone who gets this will work much harder at making a startup\nsucceed\u2014with the proverbial energy of a drowning man, in fact.\nBut understanding the relationship between money and work also\nchanges the way you work.

If you're sufficiently perceptive you can grasp these things\nwhile you're still in school.  Sam Altman did.  He must have, because\nLoopt is no class project.  And as his example suggests, this can\nbe valuable knowledge.  At a minimum, if you get this stuff, you\nalready have most of what you gain from the \"work experience\"\nemployers consider so desirable.

What should you do now?\nFor both jobs and grad school, there are ways to prepare while\nyou're in college.  If you want to get a job when you graduate, you\nshould get summer jobs at places you'd like to work.  If you want\nto go to grad school, it will help to work on research projects as\nan undergrad.  What's the equivalent for startups?  How do you keep\nyour options maximally open?", "One thing you can do while you're still in school is to learn how\nstartups work.  Unfortunately that's not easy.  Few if any colleges\nhave classes about startups.  There may be business school classes\non entrepreneurship, as they call it over there, but these are\nlikely to be a waste of time.  Business schools like to talk about\nstartups, but philosophically they're at the opposite end of the\nspectrum.  Most books on startups also seem to be useless.  I've\nlooked at a few and none get it right.  Books in most fields are\nwritten by people who know the subject from experience, but for\nstartups there's a unique problem:  by definition the founders of\nsuccessful startups don't need to write books to make money. As a\nresult most books on the subject end up being written by people who\ndon't understand it.", "So I'd be skeptical of classes and books.  The way to learn about\nstartups is by watching them in action, preferably by working at\none.  How do you do that as an undergrad?  Probably by sneaking in\nthrough the back door. Just hang around a lot and gradually start\ndoing things for them.  Most startups are (or should be) very\ncautious about hiring.  Every hire increases the burn rate, and bad\nhires early on are hard to recover from.  However, startups usually\nhave a fairly informal atmosphere, and there's always a lot that\nneeds to be done.  If you just start doing stuff for them, many\nwill be too busy to shoo you away.  You can thus gradually work\nyour way into their confidence, and maybe turn it into an official\njob later, or not, whichever you prefer.  This won't work for all\nstartups, but it would work for most I've known.", "Number two, make the most of the great advantage of school: the\nwealth of co-founders.  Look at the people around you and ask\nyourself which you'd like to work with.  When you apply that test,\nyou may find you get surprising results.  You may find you'd prefer\nthe quiet guy you've mostly ignored to someone who seems impressive\nbut has an attitude to match.  I'm not suggesting you suck up to\npeople you don't really like because you think one day they'll be\nsuccessful.  Exactly the opposite, in fact: you should only start\na startup with someone you like, because a startup will put your\nfriendship through a stress test.  I'm just saying you should think\nabout who you really admire and hang out with them, instead of\nwhoever circumstances throw you together with.", "Another thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to you\nin a startup.  These may be different from the skills you'd learn\nto get a job.  For example, thinking about getting a job will make\nyou want to learn programming languages you think employers want,\nlike Java and C++.  Whereas if you start a startup, you get to pick\nthe language, so you have to think about which will actually let\nyou get the most done.  If you use that test you might end up\nlearning Ruby or Python instead.", "\nBut the most important skill for a startup founder isn't a programming\ntechnique.  It's a knack for understanding users and figuring out\nhow to give them what they want.  I know I repeat this, but that's\nbecause it's so important.  And it's a skill you can learn, though\nperhaps habit might be a better word.  Get into the habit of thinking\nof software as having users.  What do those users want?  What would\nmake them say wow?", "This is particularly valuable for undergrads, because the concept\nof users is missing from most college programming classes.  The way\nyou get taught programming in college would be like teaching writing\nas grammar, without mentioning that its purpose is to communicate\nsomething to an audience.  Fortunately an audience for software is\nnow only an http request away.  So in addition to the programming\nyou do for your classes, why not build some kind of website people\nwill find useful?

You don't expect photographic accuracy in something\nthat looks like a quick sketch.  So one widely used trick, especially\namong illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or drawing\nlook like it was done faster than it was.

The Louvre\nmight as well replace it with copy; no one would be able to tell.\nAnd yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting.

After a few\ndays the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting.\nAnother is to stand close.  A painting familiar from reproductions\nlooks more familiar from ten feet away; close in you see details\nthat get lost in reproductions, and which you're therefore seeing\nfor the first time.", "There are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing a\nwork of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances, and\ntricks played by the artist.  Tricks are straightforward to correct\nfor. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working.\nFor example, when I was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushed\nlettering that looked like shiny metal.

When you notice a whiff of dishonesty coming\nfrom some kind of art, stop and figure out what's going on.  When\nsomeone is obviously pandering to an audience that's easily fooled,\nwhether it's someone making shiny stuff to impress ten year olds,\nor someone making conspicuously avant-garde stuff to impress would-be\nintellectuals, learn how they do it.

So saying startups should move to Silicon Valley\nseemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American telling\nthem that if they wanted to do things right they should all just\nmove to America.", "Actually I'm less American than I seem.  I didn't say so, but I'm\nBritish by birth.  And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell\nJewish jokes, I don't feel like I have to bother being diplomatic\nwith a British audience.", "The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley\nis not even a nationalistic one.\n", "[", "1", "]", "\nIt's the same thing I say to\nstartups in the US.  Y Combinator alternates between coasts every\n6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston.  And even though\nBoston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),\nwe tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to\nmove to Silicon Valley.  If that's true of Boston, it's even more\ntrue of every other city.", "This is about cities, not countries.", "And I think I can prove I'm right.  You can easily reduce the\nopposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum.\nFew would be willing to claim that it doesn't matter at all where\na startup is\u2014that a startup operating out of a small agricultural\ntown wouldn't benefit from moving to a startup hub.  Most people\ncould see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was\ninfrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to\nmake them work, and other people trying to do it.  And yet whatever\nargument you use to prove that startups don't need to move from\nLondon to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups\ndon't need to move from smaller towns to London.", "The difference between cities is a matter of degree.  And if, as\nnearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in Silicon\nValley than Boston, then they're better off in Silicon Valley than\neverywhere else too.", "I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion,\nbecause startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator.\nBut the American startups we've funded will attest that I say the\nsame thing to them.", "I'm not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon\nValley to succeed.  Just that all other things being equal, the\nmore of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there.\nBut other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving.\nI'm not saying founders with families should uproot them to move\nhalfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction.", "Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put.\nDealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for some\nreason it seems to consume all your attention.  A startup can't\nafford much of that.  One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6\nmonths working on moving to the US.  Eventually they just gave up,\nbecause they couldn't afford to take so much time away from working\non their software.", "(If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley,\nthe single best thing they could do might be to create a special\nvisa for startup founders.  US immigration policy is one of Silicon \nValley's biggest weaknesses.)", "If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may be\nbetter off in one of its centers.  A startup doing something related\nto entertainment might want to be in New York or LA.", "And finally, if a good investor has committed to fund\nyou if you stay where you are, you should probably stay.  Finding\ninvestors is hard.  You generally shouldn't pass up a definite\nfunding offer to move.\n", "2", "In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage of\nstartup hubs.  Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive\nthan Boston ones.  Over and over, I've seen startups we've funded\nsnatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston\ninvestors who saw them first but acted too slowly.  At this year's\nBoston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year,\nso if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer.\nAnd yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west\ncoast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week\nbefore beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years.  By the\ntime the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already\ngone.", "Boston investors will admit they're more conservative.  Some want\nto believe this comes from the city's prudent Yankee character.\nBut Occam's razor suggests the truth is less flattering.  Boston\ninvestors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors\nfor the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than\nBoston ones.  They don't understand startups as well.", "West coast investors aren't bolder because they're irresponsible\ncowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic.  They're\nbolder because they know what they're doing.  They're the skiers\nwho ski on the diamond slopes.  Boldness is the essence of venture\ninvesting.  The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid\nlosses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And\nthe big hits often look risky at first.", "Like Facebook.  Facebook was started in Boston.  Boston VCs had the\nfirst shot at them.  But they said no, so Facebook moved to Silicon\nValley and raised money there.  The partner who turned them down\nnow says that \"may turn out to have been a mistake.\"", "Empirically, boldness wins.  If the aggressive ways of west coast\ninvestors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a long\ntime coming.  Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston since\nthe 1970s.  If there was going to be a comeuppance for the west\ncoast investors, the bursting of the Bubble would have been it.\nBut since then the west coast has just pulled further ahead.", "West coast investors are confident enough of their judgement to act\nboldly; east coast investors, not so much; but anyone who thinks\neast coast investors act that way out of prudence should see the\nfrantic reactions of an east coast VC in the process of losing a\ndeal to a west coast one.", "In addition to the concentration that comes from specialization,\nstartup hubs are also markets.  And markets are usually centralized.\nEven now, when traders could be anywhere, they cluster in a few\ncities.  It's hard to say exactly what it is about face to face\ncontact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet\nbeen duplicated by technology.", "Walk down University Ave at the right time, and you might overhear\nfive different people talking on the phone about deals.  In fact,\nthis is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time:\nit's hard to stand that year round.  But though it can sometimes\nbe annoying to be surrounded by people who only think about one\nthing, it's the place to be if that one thing is what you're trying\nto do.", "I was talking recently to someone who works on search at Google.\nHe knew a lot of people at Yahoo, so he was in a good position to\ncompare the two companies.

He said it wasn't anything specific Google did, but simply\nthat they understood search so much better.", "And that's why startups thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley.\nStartups are a very specialized business, as specialized as diamond\ncutting.

You can barely\nrenovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.", "\n", "  That was her actual word.

It's basically the diminutive form of\nbelligerent.  Someone who's scrappy manages to be both threatening\nand undignified at the same time.

Can we claim founders are better off as a result of this\nnew type of venture firm?  I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, because\nYC is an improved version of what happened to our startup, and our\ncase was not atypical.  We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed money\nfrom our friend Julian.  He was a lawyer and arranged all our\npaperwork, so we could just code.

We certainly manage that.", "So who is our 7% coming out of?  If the founders end up net ahead\nit's not coming out of them.  So is it coming out of later stage\ninvestors?  Well, they do end up paying more.  But I think they pay\nmore because the company is actually more valuable.  And later stage\ninvestors have no problem with that.  The returns of a VC fund\ndepend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not how\ncheaply they can buy stock in them.", "If what we do is useful, why wasn't anyone doing it before?  There\nare two answers to that.  One is that people were doing it before,\njust haphazardly on a smaller scale.  Before us, seed funding came\nprimarily from individual angel investors.  Larry and Sergey, for\nexample, got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the\nfounders of Sun.  And because he was a startup guy he probably gave\nthem useful advice.  But raising money from angel investors is a\nhit or miss thing.  It's a sideline for most of them, so they only\ndo a handful of deals a year and they don't spend a lot of time on\nthe startups they invest in.  And they're hard to reach, because\nthey don't want random startups pestering them with business plans.\nThe Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knew\nBechtolsheim.  It generally takes a personal introduction with\nangels.", "The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till\nrecently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup.  You'll\nnotice we haven't funded any biotech startups.  That's still\nexpensive.  But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap\nthat you really can get a company airborne for $15,000.

It's not just that the problems we face\nare different; the whole structure of the business is different.\nVCs are playing a zero-sum game.  They're all competing for a slice\nof a fixed amount of \"deal flow,\" and that explains a lot of their\nbehavior.

But if A supports,\nsay, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something\nyou can fix by writing library functions.", "[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top;\nit's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at\nleast a partial order.", "[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.\nIn practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp\nfeatures like lexical closures and rest parameters.", "[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take\nthe form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly\nneutral that they're really works of anthropology.  People who\nvalue their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  But the question\nis only half a religious one; there is something there worth\nstudying, especially if you want to design new languages.", "\n", "\nYou'll find this essay and 14 others in\n", ".",

All adults know what their culture \nlies to kids about: they're the questions you answer \"Ask\nyour parents.\"  If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982\nor what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him.\nBut if a kid asks you \"Is there a God?\" or \"What's a prostitute?\"\nyou'll probably say \"Ask your parents.\"", "Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world\npresented to them.  The biggest disagreements are between parents\nand schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful what\nthey say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what\nparents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the\nschool into keeping \n", " or move their kids to a new school.", "The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so\nonly by discovering internal contradictions in what they're told.\nIt can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation.\nHere's what happened to Einstein:\n", "[", "2", "]", "\nI remember that feeling.

And kids do need protecting.  The environment\nyou want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the\nstreets of a big city.", "That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.  It's certainly\nnot a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is\nquiet and warm and safe.

To mislead someone so grossly about the\nworld would seem not protection but abuse.  That's an extreme\nexample, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes\nnational news.  But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in\nthe malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.", "The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment\nfor children to grow up in.  And it seems great for 10 year olds.\nI liked living in suburbia when I was 10.  I didn't notice how\nsterile it was.  My whole world was no bigger than a few friends'\nhouses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in.  On a log scale\nI was midway between crib and globe.  A suburban street was just\nthe right size.  But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel\nsuffocatingly fake.", "Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it's often frustrating at\n15.  This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one\nreason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed\nfor 10 year olds.", "What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them\nin suburbia?  A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that\nher 3 year old daughter \"saw too much.\"  Off the top of my head,\nthat might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness,\ngruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of\noddness, and violent anger.", "I think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year\nold.  I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even\nthen.  I wouldn't want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I\nsaw.  It would be too frightening.  A lot of the things adults\nconceal from smaller children, they conceal because they'd be\nfrightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such\nthings.  Misleading the child is just a byproduct.", "This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to\nkids.  But because the lies are indirect we don't keep a very strict\naccounting of them.  Parents know they've concealed the facts about\nsex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more.\nBut few tell their kids about the differences between the real world\nand the cocoon they grew up in.  Combine this with the confidence\nparents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new\ncrop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.", "Don't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world?  Actually\nthis seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old.\nIn preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult\nworld and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings.  They\ncould see they weren't as strong or skillful as the village smith.\nIn past times people lied to kids about some things more than we\ndo now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment\nare a recent invention.  Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got\nthis first.  Children of kings and great magnates were the first\nto grow up out of touch with the world.  Suburbia means half the\npopulation can live like kings in that respect.", "\n", "I'd have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York.\nI'd worry less about what they'd see, and more about what they'd\ndo.  I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan,\nand as a rule they seemed pretty jaded.  They seemed to have lost\ntheir virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried\nmore drugs than I'd even heard of.", "The reasons parents don't want their teenage kids having sex are\ncomplex.  There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually\ntransmitted diseases.  But those aren't the only reasons parents\ndon't want their kids having sex.  The average parents of a 14 year\nold girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were\nzero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.", "Kids can probably sense they aren't being told the whole story.\nAfter all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as\nmuch a problem for adults, and they have sex.", "What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex?\nTheir dislike of the idea is so visceral it's probably inborn.  But\nif it's inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of\nsocieties where parents don't mind if their teenage kids have\nsex\u2014indeed, where it's normal for 14 year olds to become\nmothers.  So what's going on?  There does seem to be a universal\ntaboo against sex with prepubescent children.  One can imagine\nevolutionary reasons for that.  And I think this is the main reason\nparents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having\nsex.  They still think of them as children, even though biologically\nthey're not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.", "One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs:\nthat it can cause great pleasure.  That's what makes sex and drugs\nso dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one's judgement\u2014which\nis especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the\nalready wretched judgement of a teenage kid.", "Here parents' desires conflict.  Older societies told kids they had\nbad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident.\nThis may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in\ntheir place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly\nlied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lie\nagain about all the things they might get into trouble with if they\nbelieved us.", "If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would\nbe: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy\njudgement.  People with twice your experience still get burned by\nthem.  But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn't\nbe convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is\nbelieving you have good judgement.  When you're too weak to lift\nsomething, you can tell, but when you're making a decision impetuously,\nyou're all the more sure of it.", "\n", "Another reason parents don't want their kids having sex is that\nthey want to keep them innocent.  Adults have a certain model of\nhow kids are supposed to behave, and it's different from what they\nexpect of other adults.", "One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed\nto use.  Most parents use words when talking to other adults that\nthey wouldn't want their kids using.  They try to hide even the\nexistence of these words for as long as they can.  And this is\nanother of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone\nknows you're not supposed to swear in front of kids.", "I've never heard more different explanations for anything parents\ntell kids than why they shouldn't swear.  Every parent I know forbids\ntheir children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same\njustification.  It's clear most start with not wanting kids to\nswear, then make up the reason afterward.", "So my theory about what's going on is that the ", " of\nswearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.  There's no difference\nin the meaning of \"shit\" and \"poopoo.\"  So why should one be ok for\nkids to say and one forbidden?  The only explanation is: by definition.\n", "3", "Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for\nadults?   The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning\nagainst a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of\nhis mouth is very disconcerting.  But why?", "One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we're programmed to\nlike certain kinds of helplessness.  I've several times heard mothers\nsay they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children's\nmispronunciations because they were so cute.  And if you think about\nit, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to\nbe cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual\nlimbs.", "It's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect\nhelpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for\nso long.  Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they'd be\nvery annoying.  They'd merely seem like incompetent adults.  But\nthere's more to it than that.  The reason our hypothetical jaded\n10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be annoying,\nbut that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early.  To\nbe jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any\ntheory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty\nnarrow one.", "Innocence is also open-mindedness.  We want kids to be innocent so\nthey can continue to learn.  Paradoxical as it sounds, there are\nsome kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of\nknowledge.  If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal\nplace full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you're\nbetter off learning it last.  Otherwise you won't bother learning\nmuch more.", "Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don't think\nthis is a coincidence.  I think they've deliberately avoided learning\nabout certain things.  Certainly I do.  I used to think I wanted\nto know everything.  Now I know I don't.", "\n", "After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about\nto kids.  Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.  But\nwhy do we conceal death from kids?   Probably because small children\nare particularly horrified by it.  They want to feel safe, and death\nis the ultimate threat.", "One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the\ndeath of our first cat.  Over the years, as we asked for more\ndetails, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite\nelaborate.  The cat had died at the vet's office.  Of what?  Of the\nanaesthesia itself.  Why was the cat at the vet's office?  To be\nfixed.  And why had such a routine operation killed it?  It wasn't\nthe vet's fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia\nwas too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have\nknown this in advance.  It was not till we were in our twenties\nthat the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally\nstepped on the cat and broken its back.", "They didn't feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat\nheaven.  My parents never claimed that people or animals who died\nhad \"gone to a better place,\" or that we'd meet them again.  It\ndidn't seem to harm us.", "My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my\ngrandfather.  She said they'd been sitting reading one day, and\nwhen she said something to him, he didn't answer.  He seemed to be\nasleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn't.  \"He was\ngone.\" Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.  Later I\nlearned it hadn't been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most\nof a day to kill him.", "Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing\nthe subject when death came up.  I can't remember that, of course,\nbut I can infer it from the fact that I didn't really grasp I was\ngoing to die till I was about 19.  How could I have missed something\nso obvious for so long?  Now that I've seen parents managing the\nsubject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly\nturned aside.", "On this topic, especially, they're met half-way by kids.  Kids often\nwant to be lied to.  They want to believe they're living in a\ncomfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe\nit.\n", "4", "\n", "Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group\nand want their kids to feel it too.  This usually requires two\ndifferent kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he\nor she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes\ndifferentiate themselves by believing.\n", "5", "Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity\nis one of the stickiest things you can tell them.  Almost anything\nelse you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when\nthey start to think for themselves.  But if you tell a kid they're\na member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.", "This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated\nlies parents tell.  When parents are of different religions, they'll\noften agree between themselves that their children will be \"raised\nas Xes.\"  And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering\nthemselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen\nthe other way, they'd have grown up considering themselves as Ys.", "One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved.\nThe truth is common property.  You can't distinguish your group by\ndoing things that are rational, and believing things that are true.\nIf you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to\ndo things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false.\nAnd after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary\nand believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by\n\"outsiders\" on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing\nchildren to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.  If they\naren't an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs\nand customs?  If they aren't an X, why do all the non-Xes call them\none?", "This form of lie is not without its uses.  You can use it to carry\na payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of\nthe child's identity.  You can tell the child that in addition to\nnever wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by\na giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating\nfish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.  Then X\nchildren will grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be\nhonest and industrious.", "This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions,\nand explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful\nand the bizarre.  The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick,\nand the useful half is the payload.\n", "6", "\n", "One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain\npower over them.  Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a\nchild molester telling his victims they'll get in trouble if they\ntell anyone what happened to them.  Others seem more innocent; it\ndepends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they\nuse it for.", "Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children.\nUsually their motives are mixed.  For example, a father who has an\naffair generally conceals it from his children.  His motive is\npartly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce\nthe topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit)\nthat he doesn't want to tarnish himself in their eyes.", "If you want to learn what lies are told to kids, read almost any\nbook written to teach them about \"issues.\"\n", "7", "\nPeter Mayle wrote\none called ", "  It begins with the three\nmost important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:\n", "[", "8", "]", "\nReally?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly\nhis wife's fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this.\nMaybe it's more important for kids to respect their parents than\nto know the truth about them.", "But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist\non high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling\nthey fall hopelessly short.  They walk around feeling horribly evil\nfor having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around\nthem are doing much worse things.", "This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.  The more\nconfident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a\nquestion \"I don't know.\"  Less confident people feel they have to\nhave an answer or they'll look bad.  My parents were pretty good\nabout admitting when they didn't know things, but I must have been\ntold a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard\na teacher say \"I don't know\" till I got to college.  I remember\nbecause it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of\na class.", "The first hint I had that teachers weren't omniscient came in sixth\ngrade, after my father contradicted something I'd learned in school.\nWhen I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father\nreplied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about\u2014that\nhe was just an elementary school teacher, after all.", " a teacher?  The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed.\nDidn't teachers know everything about the subjects they taught?\nAnd if not, why were they the ones teaching us?", "The sad fact is, US public school teachers don't generally understand\nthe stuff they're teaching very well.  There are some sterling\nexceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank\nacademically near the bottom of the college population.  So the\nfact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible\nshows what a job the system must have done on my brain.", "\n", "What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.

I wonder if it\nwouldn't have been better just to tell us the truth: that there\nweren't any famous black scientists.  Ranking George Washington\nCarver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about\nthe obstacles blacks faced in his time.", "As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.  By the time\nyou got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was\npretty much pure propaganda.  For example, we were taught to regard\npolitical leaders as saints\u2014especially the recently martyred\nKennedy and King.

In the original Java white paper, Gosling\nexplicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult for\nprogrammers used to C.

Like the creators\nof sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java's designers were\nconsciously designing a product for people not as smart as them.\nHistorically, languages designed for other people to use have been\nbad:  Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++.

It's pseudo-hip.  Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots,\nopen-source language effort like Perl or Python.  This one just\nhappens to be controlled by a giant company.

{"Title": ["Being Popular"], "Content": ["May 2001", "A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems\nexpert that he wanted to design a really good\nprogramming language.  The expert told him that it would be a\nwaste of time, that programming languages don't become popular\nor unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how\ngood his language was, no one would use it.  At least, that\nwas what had happened to the language ", " had designed.", "What does make a language popular?  Do popular\nlanguages deserve their popularity?  Is it worth trying to\ndefine a good programming language?  How would you do it?", "I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking \nat hackers, and learning what they want.  Programming\nlanguages are ", " hackers, and a programming language\nis good as a programming language (rather than, say, an\nexercise in denotational semantics or compiler design)\nif and only if hackers like it.", "It's true, certainly, that most people don't choose programming\nlanguages simply based on their merits.  Most programmers are told\nwhat language to use by someone else.  And yet I think the effect\nof such external factors on the popularity of programming languages\nis not as great as it's sometimes thought to be. I think a bigger\nproblem is that a hacker's idea of a good programming language is\nnot the same as most language designers'.", "Between the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters.\nProgramming languages are not theorems. They're tools, designed\nfor people, and they have to be designed to suit human strengths\nand weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet.\nIf a shoe pinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however\nelegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.", "It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language\nfrom a bad one.

And popularity further separates\ngood languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live users\nalways leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular language\nhas changed during its life. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases,\nbut even Lisp has changed a lot.

How are they to hear? From other hackers. But there has to\nbe some initial group of hackers using the language for others even\nto hear about it. I wonder how large this group has to be; how many\nusers make a critical mass?

I would not be surprised if it is\nharder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.\nThe best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use\na trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which\nhappens to be written in the new language.", "Let's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect\nthe popularity of a programming language. To become popular, a\nprogramming language has to be the scripting language of a popular\nsystem. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early\nIBM mainframes.

Many Perl\nprograms probably begin as just a couple library calls stuck\ntogether.", "I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages\nin the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. I\nthink future programming languages will have libraries that are as\ncarefully designed as the core language.

The\nconventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is\nthe real one. I'm not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary\nprogrammers panic. But I don't think ordinary programmers' opinions\nmatter. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert\nhackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to\ndeal with prefix notation.

This is especially true\nfor math expressions. I've used Lisp my whole programming life and\nI still don't find prefix math expressions natural.

Language designers like to\nwrite fast compilers. That's how they measure their skill. They\nthink of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a good\nprofiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written\nin the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here,\nagain, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their\nusers. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong\nproblem.", "It might be a good idea to have an active profiler-- to push\nperformance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to\ncome asking for it.

In the capital cost of a business offering a server-based\napplication, this is the divisor.", "For years, efficiency hasn't mattered much in most end-user\napplications. Developers have been able to assume that each user\nwould have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their\ndesk.

Then the interface will\ntend to be owned by one of them. The lower of two levels will either\nbe a language in which the upper is written, in which case the\nlower level will own the interface, or it will be a slave, in which\ncase the interface can be dictated by the upper level.", "What all this implies is that there is hope for a new Lisp.

For example, explicit support for programs\nwith multiple users, or data ownership at the level of type tags.", "Server-based applications also give us the answer to the question\nof what this new Lisp will be used to hack. It would not hurt to\nmake Lisp better as a scripting language for Unix. (It would be\nhard to make it worse.) But I think there are areas where existing\nlanguages would be easier to beat. I think it might be better to\nfollow the model of Tcl, and supply the Lisp together with a complete\nsystem for supporting server-based applications. Lisp is a natural\nfit for server-based applications. Lexical closures provide a way\nto get the effect of subroutines when the ui is just a series of\nweb pages.

Most people find it\nuncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing\nsomething else.", "So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.\nBut that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are\npeople working hard to distract you.  Distraction is not a static\nobstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.\nDistraction seeks you out.", "Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.  Distracting\nis, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.  And technology is\ncontinually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.\nWhich means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,\nnew ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.", "Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached\nthe point where it's like visual crack.

A quarter\nof their life.", "TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more\naddictive ways of wasting time.  And what's especially dangerous\nis that many happen at your computer.  This is no accident.  An\never larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers\nconnected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward\nthe procrastinators.", "I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for\nwork.  I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp\nfiles, but most of the time I was offline.  All I could do was write\nand program.  Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my\ndesk.  Terribly addictive things are just a click away.  Run into\nan obstacle in what you're working on?  Hmm, I wonder what's new\nonline.  Better check.", "After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,\nand Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because\nI didn't realize that it evolves.  Something that used to be safe,\nusing the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.  Some\ndays I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check\nemail, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then\nsuddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real\nwork done.  And this started to happen more and more often.", "It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet\nhad become, because the problem was intermittent.  I ignored it the\nway you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.  When\nI was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a\nproblem.  It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding\nwhat to do next that they always bit me.", "Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type\nof distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with\nit.  If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,\nI'd have noticed very quickly.  That's a known danger sign, like\ndrinking alone.  But using the Internet still looked and felt a \nlot like work.", "Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much\nmore distracting that I had to start treating it differently.\nBasically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time\nsinks: Firefox."]},
